Retrospective techniques:
Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel
Is a three step process where a facilitator moderates a feedback discussion.
The facilitator asks questions about the process with 5 keywords Start, Stop, Continue, More of and Less of. The feedback received is marked into a 
circle with the 5 categories. 
The feedback meeting is short in nature, but the facilitator should encourage feedback. 

Glad, Sad, Mad
This technique is a little longer in terms of the meeting. The startgin objective is to get the participants to write their positive or negative observations on to index cards. THis should take up to 15 min. Then the observations are placed into categories on a white board according to themees of Glad, Sad and Mad. After the observations are set on the whiteboard they are grouped together if they describe the same issue. Then a vote ensues where the participants vote on the topics they want to discuss further and the chair of the discussion starts discussing the issues in order of votes. The discussion should be focused on actions for the next iteration.
